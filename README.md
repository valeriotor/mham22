Project for the Mobile Health and Activity Monitoring course taken in Spring Semester 2022.

The project revolves around the analysis of the data output of a Lilygo smartwatch for various purposes.

The three tasks consisted of:
1. An offline step counting algorithm that would use the band's accelerometer sensor.
2. Several recordings while wearing the band and traversing certain paths in ZÃ¼rich under specific constraints. (not included in this repository)
3. An offline algorithm that, along with step counting, would be able to determine the path traversed by the user, the activities performed during the recording, and the band's position on the body.

The final submissions for task 1 and 3 are included in task1/Submission and task3/Submission. The main documentation for the final algorithm is in task3/Submission/group07_documentation.pdf
